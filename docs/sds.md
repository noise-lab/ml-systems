# Student Disability Services - Accommodation FAQ

**Note:** This document outlines my SDS accommodation policies for all of my classes. Some references may not apply to your specific course (e.g., debates, presentations, or other activities that may not be part of every course).

## Exam Accommodations

### Extra Time (1.25x, 1.5x)

**This accommodation does not apply to exams in my courses.**

- All exams in my courses are **untimed** - there are no time limits imposed
- Students may use the full exam period to complete their work
- Because exams are already untimed, the extra time accommodation does not provide additional benefit

### Reduced Distraction Testing Environment

**The standard exam environment is designed to be quiet and distraction-free.**

- All exams are administered in a quiet classroom setting
- If you require a separate room due to your accommodation needs, you may take the exam **one day early** in my office or a TA's office
- **The exam must be taken in the presence of a TA or instructor**
- **Any rescheduled exams will include an additional oral component**
- **Important:** You must request alternate exam scheduling **at least two weeks in advance** of the exam date

### Computer Use for Exams

**This accommodation cannot be implemented in my courses.**

- All exams are multiple choice or very short answer format
- Use of computers or typed responses is not permitted during exams
- This format is an essential requirement of the course assessment structure

## Classroom Access Accommodations

### Audio Recording of Lectures

**I do not consent to audio or video recording of complete lectures.**

Alternative accommodations available:
- I have recorded lectures online (on YouTube) that are linked from the course website
- You may take photographs of slides and whiteboard content (see below)
- You may use a computer/laptop for note-taking during class
- Office hours are available for clarification on any lecture content

### Computer Use for Note-Taking

**Permission granted.**
- You may use a laptop or tablet for note-taking during class
- Please be respectful of other students by positioning your screen so it's not distracting to those around you

### Permission to Photograph Visual Content

**Permission granted.**
- You may photograph slides, whiteboard content, and other visual materials presented in class
- These materials are for your personal study use only and may not be shared publicly

## Assignment Accommodations

### Deadline Extensions

**No special accommodations are provided beyond the standard course policy.**

**How the grace period system works:**
- All students (including those with SDS deadline extension accommodations) receive the same grace period: **96 hours of flexible late time**
- You can use this time flexibly across all assignments throughout the quarter
- Every hour late (or fraction) counts against your balance
- This policy already incorporates flexibility for students who need additional time

**Important:**
- You must still complete all assignments to pass the course
- Once your grace period is exhausted, late work receives half credit if submitted within one week

### Flexibility with Attendance/Participation Policy

**How it works:**
- I do not take formal attendance in my courses
- Participation is a component of your final grade

**For in-class quizzes:**
- In-class quizzes are part of the participation grade
- There are no make-up quizzes
- Your grade will be based only on quizzes actually taken

**For other in-class activities (e.g., presentation, debate):**
- When these components are part of the course, they are essential learning requirements
- Students sign up for the date they wish to participate in these activities
- Since you control when you participate, you can select a date that works with your schedule and accommodation needs

## Communication and Process

### Before Each Exam

**If you need a reduced-distraction testing environment in a separate room:**
- Contact me at least **two weeks in advance** of the exam
- We will schedule you to take the exam one day early in my office or a TA's office, in the presence of a TA or instructor
- The rescheduled exam will include an additional oral component
- I will confirm the date, time, and location with you

### For Ongoing Accommodations

**Approved without further action needed:**
- Computer/laptop use for note-taking in class
- Photography of visual content (slides, whiteboard)

**Requires communication:**
- Separate exam room (two weeks advance notice)

### If You Have Concerns

- Reach out to me via email or during office hours
- You can also contact your SDS director if you have questions about implementation
- All discussions will be kept confidential
